<h1>When Your Faith Kills Your Faith</h1>
<h2>an honest explanation.</h2>

<p>
To whoever is reading this,

Know that I do not desire to “destroy testimony”, “promote anti-Mormon/anti-LDS viewpoints”, or whatever grounds for excommunication or apostasy could be drummed up from my honest telling of MY story - of MY life, specifically the events relating to where I am now: left sapped of any and all faith in the LDS faith, exhausted at the idea of Jesus Christ, and possibly even unbelieving of the idea of a God, at least in the Christian theology.

To begin, we have to go through a bit of my personal history, and it’s relating to faith. I tell my story purely from my own perspective, and with all due respect, the perspective of others involved does not hold much, if any, sway to my personal opinions and lack of faith. In fact, opinions in opposition to mine - specifically relating to my beliefs and faith throughout my life - are laughable; who would be so egotistical to assume to know MY beliefs?

We begin early in my life, before I was a teenager. I was raised in a good, God-fearing, Mormon (when that was still legal to use) household. I grew up reading the scriptures; I grew up wanting to be a General Authority. I wanted so sincerely to be given some high and mighty calling from God. See, one thing that many don’t realize about growing up in the church is that you become so accustomed to being GIVEN your next task in life. Whether this is a cultural phenomenon or something doctrinal, or simply an intermingling of both, I have no answer; but either way, the path for a young Mormon boy is thus:

Become a “valiant” young man, a young man who is morally clean (according to the morals espoused by the faith), a young man who automatically defers to God and “His authorized representatives” for just about every decision bigger than what you want to eat for breakfast.
Receive your Patriarchal Blessing - God’s roadmap for what will occur during this life (or the next if you’re unlucky enough to have gone some different route of your choosing).
After high school, if you “pray enough”, then God will surely give you concrete evidence through good feelings and “the Spirit” to serve a two-year mission, where you will not only have limited familial contact, but will also be “encouraged” to never send home anything negative or non-faith-promoting. You and your family will pay for this mission. There are most certainly cases where tithing and donations from others will be used, but let’s be honest, to not pay for your own mission with your or your family’s funds is a pretty big Mormon-culture misstep.
“Return With Honor” from your mission, aka survive the two years. If you came home early for any reason, it is automatically assumed to either be a debilitating health issue or a matter of you being “unworthy”. Returning home early is, in most Young Single Adult Wards and Branches, a social suicide of the highest proportions. Many young men will stay on their missions, knowing full well that they are “in the wrong” with God. This does not, in any way, help his mental state. It’s not a good place to be.
Go to college as soon as possible, get married as soon as possible, rush to have children, and “Endure to the End.”
The end...right?

Now that we’ve gotten this path that I, at the very least, was taught and exposed to, let’s dive into things. As a youth, I faced a solid amount of struggles, and faced many of them in silence; exactly as the church wishes. I faced testimony issues, lashed out, desired to be heard and validated when I stated that I just didn’t believe, and the response? Only church-approved materials, only things of goodly report. My own thoughts and opinions? They only mattered if they lead me towards the “true church”. Of course, this did not help my growing idea that maybe, just maybe, my desires to kill myself and my fantasizing of ending it all were depression or anxiety in one of it’s many forms. The response to that? “No, it can’t be.”

We’ll talk a lot about the mental trauma one faces as a young man in this religion.

But, I continued to resist, in small, personal ways. I gave up on daily scripture reading. I stopped praying. I had no faith in a God. I only had faith in the fact that I am. I think, therefore I am. And this was enough. But... the traumas I had collected already, combined with the lack of support and validation, caused me to be deeply, deeply disconnected from life and happiness in general. I was just a young teen, trying to fit in with the world, and was caught in an absolutely massive rift between the Mormon existence and the non-Mormon existence, and it was tearing me apart.

It got to the point where I repeatedly told my Priesthood Leaders that no, I did not believe, and yet somehow I was always given a Temple Recommend. Somehow, no matter what I did as a youth, no matter what my beliefs were, it was the opinion of the leaders that I would definitely come around after experiencing some of the “holier” parts of the religion. It also didn’t help that I had begun to adopt a common practise in the religion. This practise, which I will dub “masking” for lack of a better term, involves “masking” your true beliefs, ideals, and self, when surrounded by those who have connections to the church. Never, ever, EVER be a disruptive figure. It’s okay to give little white lies so as to not contradict the narrative you’re giving those around you.

So of course, despite my family’s best attempts to “mask” what I had unmasked to them, eventually the gossiping began. I was viewed as a troublemaker, a sinner, a fiend, a youth unfit to spend time with their little angel children. I was an absolute pariah to the adults in my childhood Ward. And it was so. I decided that, if that was their viewpoint, and I’ve been trying to hard to fit in and not do what they’re saying I am, why not just… do them? Why not just… enjoy the life they want so desperately for me to have so that they don’t have to assign blame to their children, or, God forbid, themselves, for how their children are acting?

And so I finally told my parents and my family that, no, I had zero faith, zero belief, zero testimony in the church. I just didn’t. It was a waste of my Sunday, when I could be hanging with friends, doing homework, or literally anything else. And so I dwindled to only going to the first hour of the three hour block every Sunday. And such was life.

There was, however, a seed beginning to be planted in my heart. It arose after going on a Stake Nauvoo trip - when I had met many friends, and experienced, for the first time, that the church’s youth program could, in fact, be fun to some degree. Of course, I felt absolutely nothing spiritual the entire time, was not allowed into the Nauvoo Temple (because at this time my Bishop had finally taken my recommend away, as I refused to admit to him that I was, indeed, sexually active, for fear of the Ward’s lashing out towards my parents), and overall bored during anything remotely “testimony-building”, but I saw that these people were… happy. And I sure wasn’t. So, what did I do?

Exactly what the church said to do: I asked. I asked a good friend of mine, if he was indeed happy. He said yes, and explained that it came from his sure foundation in the knowledge of a loving God and his place in existence. He issued me a challenge, some sort of a test, and I followed it. Eventually, I was challenged to pray. And that was when I felt… something. I felt a warm feeling. I didn’t feel alone. There can be millions of explanations, but the one I settled on was that God had not only reached out to me, but He was offering to cure my depression, my anxiety, my fears, my pains, and all I had to do was try. So, sure, I kept going. In my own way. This was in no way a confirmation of the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon or the LDS Church, as I had only read out of the New Testament up to this point, but it was a start.

Until I graduated high school, I wrestled heavily inside myself. I, at my core, am a very logical, honest person. I seek truth. I desire understanding. And yet, I have another side. It is the hopeful romantic, which commonly expresses itself through the desire that life really is that EASY. That things really do MAKE SENSE. That there is an ANSWER. And so, after graduating, I finally decided that I’d give Mormonism a fair shot. I started reading the Book of Mormon. I subdued my logical, true self. I actively disassociated myself from the core of my being; an action that I am still working to undo, given the heavy psychological trauma one goes through when suspending their true selves for a false belief. I became worthy-ish for a temple recommend. Worthy enough to go in, I suppose. And it felt GREAT. I even went to a youth camp, Especially For Youth, or EFY for short, and it was AWESOME.

All of these good feelings that the church so happily describes as the Spirit kept telling me that, yeah, not only was this true, but I should also go on a MISSION! Surely that was the spirit, and not the fact that everyone else was doing it and that I was so programmed that it only seemed right. I even ended a relationship that I was incredibly happy with, just for this mission. I ended so, so many friendships. I cut so many people from my life. I surrounded myself with the most faithful of the faithful; the elect. And I left.

On Halloween of 2018, I left for the Missionary Training Center in Provo, Utah. And I began to learn Dutch. I began to swallow myself whole. All that I was was WILLINGLY prayed away - sacrificed in order to make more room for Jesus. At this point, my depression was reaching yet another height. In the MTC, the thoughts of suicide, the awful dreams, the desire to dissapear, all came back with a MASSIVE force. I had no outlet besides my “faith” that I had kindled in less than half a year (minus the whole life thus far of having a faithful family).

I made it out of the MTC, and was placed in the city of Groningen in the Netherlands. My trainer was an absolutely incredible help with my depression, anxiety, and psychological pain. He and I understood each other quite well, and I was grateful for his help. I grew to love speaking Dutch, and even more so than that, I grew to love speaking to random people on the street. I actively denied going knocking on doors - it never appealed to me, seemed cult-like and invasive, and just wasn’t a fan of it. However, I grew to love just making friends and connections and sharing this faith I’d subscribed to. I was convinced that I could help people come unto Christ; the specific sect never mattered. I just wanted to help people feel this “joy”, this absolute swallowing up of just about every bit of pain and trauma that added up to make you; this numbing, yellow-y feeling.

I loved Groningen. I spent six months in that city, and if it was up to me, I’d die in that city. To be fair, it still is up to me, so I may well return. Over my six months there, I’d attempted to have a couple deep talks about serious discrepancies and issues with the Book of Mormon and Church History, which, to a missionary, sounds like a field day. I discovered a little site called FairMormon, and found that, nearly every time I looked up an issue our friend had, I came out of the study with even more issues in mind. With even more discrepancies, more reasons it wasn’t true. Of course, with the previous disassociation of my logical self, I turned it off like a light switch and kept going.

I also studied the Doctrine and Covenants with the Institute Student Guide. And I tried so, so, so hard to believe it. I studied it so diligently. I prayed over it constantly. And yet, I could never believe it. It felt like someone decided to just make up random prophecy, rules, and reasons to guide the religion however they wanted and signed it in the name of Jesus just about every time.

Oh, wait, it’s pretty much that, isn’t it?

Regardless of my personal issues with the Doctrine and Covenants, my faith in the Book of Mormon was seriously flagging because of my overzealous missionary self’s delve into websites that were most certainly NOT allowed by the mission president - namely, FairMormon. How in the world one can assume horses to be tapirs is anyone’s guess. But, with these two flagging faiths, I turned to the Bible. I studied the Old Testament. And, wow. It was incredibly depressing, and I could not understand how this was, in any way, edifying or Godly. It was awful.

And then I was transferred to Arnhem, in the Netherlands. I was paired up with an Elder who was an awesome guy. I enjoyed his company and loved living with him and working with him. I have zero hard feelings for him. We even vibed well. Now, something that I’ve failed to mention so far is that I am bisexual. I have been so for as long as I can remember, and have tried praying it away, hiding it, twisting it, changing it, any kind of self-conversion therapy that you can think of, I’ve most likely tried.

So far in my mission, being open about my sexuality, and open about my past history of die-hard atheism and anti-religious sentiments had only won me compliments, respect, and gotten others to open up and at least listen. However, this Elder decided, for reasons of his own, to believe that I was “coming onto him”. The reasons behind this, as well as the circumstances surrounding them, I will not discuss, for they are not mine to discuss. But either way, he felt very uncomfortable speaking to me about this, and went behind my back to the mission president and asked for advice. My mission president gave me a very angry call while we were sleeping over with some other elders a few cities away, and we spoke. The conversation began as an accusation of sexual misconduct, and ended with me crying, professing to have done nothing wrong - which I will ALWAYS stand by, as I did nothing wrong, and him telling me that I would be emergency transferred in the morning. I was also to never tell anyone why I had been emergency transferred, and to keep it in the dark. It was to be a secret.

Oops.

My companion and I had a discussion that night, about what was happening, and about what had happened. The reason I do not hold anything against him is that I understand his side. I do. I refuse to hold him accountable. I only offer him love and support. After we spoke, he asked that I pray for us, to which I obliged. After the prayer, I had a nice feeling rest upon me. I can only describe it as whatever you relate to seeing HOME in all caps.

Just, HOME.

And so I figured I’d be going home pretty quick.

One interesting thing about emergency transfers, especially ones involving alleged sexual misconduct, is that the missionary has to have a phone call with his Stake President back home. So I did so. And I confessed to him of numerous sexual sins that I had not confessed before, some having been me “masking”, and others having been so long ago that I had simply forgotten and not bothered with them. My Stake President told me that I was fine. I had been serving diligently for almost 7 months now, why would I come home? Surely, I was in the clear.

One thing he did, however, pick up on, was my sexuality.

Less than two weeks later, my Mission President tells me that I am going home, according to a higher Authority’s decree. I am given no reason why, other than to better myself and change. So, sure. I can do that. I’d already had my returning home early panic attack the night I had that phone call, so I was ready for it. The day before I flew home I was already packed up and worked as hard as I could for as long as I could before we had to travel from Alkmaar, north of Amsterdam, to Zoetermeer, where the Mission President’s Assistants lived. I wanted so badly to stay, and it felt absolutely horrible and wrong to come home, but it also felt so horribly wrong to wear that nametag - it felt like such a LIE.

And so I came home, on the 22nd of June. And met with my Stake President. My Stake President told me how highly my Mission President spoke of me, and I even have a letter from my Mission President to my Stake President speaking highly of me, and asking that my Stake President do everything he can to help me in my transition. It seemed that this truly was an opportunity to better myself, then flip right back around and go back out. I was also given free sessions with a counselor from the LDS Family Services. These sessions with my counselor guided me through a lot of my past trauma and pains and he actually HELPED. Out of all of the people I dealt with since I came home, my counselor truly HELPED. I knew that he cared. And it was awesome. I won’t be focusing on these counseling sessions because I genuinely am grateful for the assistance given to me through him. He was incredible, and I am grateful.

I soon visited with the Branch President of my Young Single Adults Branch. We seemed, at first, to start off really well. We both wanted me back out on a mission. We both wanted me to be “healed” and “fixed” from whatever was going on with me spiritually. So, he had me do a few things to fix past relationships and make amends, which I completely agreed with. Soon enough, we even decided to have a Disciplinary Council so that we could have a clear timetable on just when things would be done and a list of just what needed to be done.

The council came and passed, and it went well, I felt. Except for the fact that every single ounce of blame for everything was placed on me. I was told that I had ruined women, ruined lives and destroyed others’ faith. That was a big hit to my psyche. However, directly after this, I was told that I was “forgiven”. I felt so relieved, so grateful. The brethren there even gave me a blessing! It seemed so perfect.

Little did I know, things would only get worse from there.

Upon receiving the official copy of my disciplinary letter, and being placed under disciplinary action, I noticed that it seemed… odd. Things that had originally only been “counsel” and “ideas to consider” were suddenly bullet points for my salvation. It is included in this letter for transparency purposes. And yes, before you ask, the last IS telling me to apologise to a girl with whom I had engaged in sexual relations. Because her faith, or lack thereof, is my fault, obviously.

I tried my best to go and volunteer on the temple grounds every Monday and Friday morning, and, in all honesty, I enjoyed it when I could make it. Pretty quickly I couldn’t make it anymore, after I got a job, but for a while it was really fun. However, pretty quickly the list of rules really started to drag. I mean, do not be alone with a woman? Guys, I don’t have guy friends, they’re all out on missions! So very early on, I was isolated, to say the least. I was absolutely mentally broken, clinging only to the idea that I can still go back out, my life isn’t over, I can still serve my mission. I was fundamentally broken, at this point. And this was where another player entered into my life.

A girl who I had met through a YSA activity and I hit it off pretty well, and we started out as just makeout buddies - I didn’t really want this, mind you, but I was at such a low, with absolutely zero sense of self worth and validation, that her wanting me felt pretty dang good. And so I hung around her, I even introduced her to a fledgling group of friends I was making. All girls, of course, as is par for the course for me.

Pretty soon, however, I could see that she was seeking to drive a wedge between one of my best friends and I, but I couldn’t really call her on it. Why, you ask? Because I was too busy trying to stop her from making out with me, telling everyone we were basically dating, and how much she loved me. She would even come with me to do service at the temple. I tried and tried to get her out of my life, but it didn’t work. If anything, it made things worse, PLUS I felt awful at the idea of hurting this girl by leaving her alone in her struggles.

Yeah, real fun situation.

So a little time passes, and right before I start my new job, a group of us YSAs plan a campout, a couple guys, a couple girls, just go camp for a night and have fun! I was stoked. We made it work out just perfectly that the girl wouldn’t come, and then, right before we go, she butts in and decides she’s coming. Which we begrudgingly accepted.

The campout was pretty fun, all things considered, until later in the evening. I wasn’t feeling too happy, due to a silly personal thing, and the girl decided that this was all about her. She then got even worse than I did, and started genuinely feeling ill, so she went inside of the tent. We had one large tent set up, which I had assumed we’d all use; however, all of the men besides myself who were staying overnight had brought hammocks or something to sleep outside with, which left me stuck in the tent. I was okay with this; these girls were all my friends, and I wasn’t very worried. My bedroll and things were in the far side of the tent, away from the women; however, when I entered the tent after the girl to make sure she was okay, I saw that she had placed her things next to mine.

She asked me to lay down with her and hold her and help her feel better, so sure, being the nice guy that I am, I did. I held her and she began to spoon me, which I allowed, because she really didn’t seem to be feeling too good. She then attempted to make out with me, which I stopped very quickly. I was then thoroughly checked out with the whole experience, and attempted to sleep the whole night.

After the campout, I had some guilt about the whole scenario, and wanted to tell the Branch President. The girl cornered me during an activity and began to tell me all about how she had “realized” that I’d took advantage of her in the tent - she claimed memory loss. And so I told her that I’d been wanting to talk to the Branch President anyways, and apologized for what she was going through, but I hadn’t done a thing to her, and told her my story.

Next thing I know, she’s gotten someone to tell the Branch President, and is telling anyone who will listen her side of the story.

And the Branch President ignores my calls and texts until the next Sunday I see him.

Where he drags me into his office, in between others who had been involved, claiming that I had done some awful things, made some bad choices, etc., basically, this was all MY fault. And I was a failure for screwing up based on what GOD had told me - He had told me to not be alone with a woman, right? And would God truly approve of a coed campout, anyways? Surely not!

Within a week, I received a phone call from my Stake President, where he told me I needed to meet with him ASAP. Oh, and I was banned, not from the YSA, but from the BUILDING it was held in; effectively cornering me back into the Family Ward where all of my trauma had begun. I met with my Family Ward Bishop, and he was quite helpful, to an extent. He really wanted to see me grow and change, which was nice. But he didn’t see me going back out on a mission. One thing I’ve come to realize is that your leaders will assume responsibility for the kind of person you become - aka, if I did not become the person they desired me to be, they had failed.

I met with my Stake President one more time, before things settled down with the whole campout conundrum. We had a good chat, but I was still given just about all of the blame. He was a lot nicer about it, though, which helped soften the blow. He then told me something that rattled me to my core - that he was in possession of a letter sent to him (and presumably my Mission President?) from the Authority who sent me home, explaining that I was sent home for reasons that I was entirely unaware of. It stated that I was sent home due to my conduct, which was unbecoming of a missionary. My conduct of being open about my sexuality, while also being openly affectionate and friendly with other men - ie, my companions. I was sent home, with basically no chance of coming back to my original mission, as the Authority did not believe I was fit to serve a mission AT ALL, all because of my sexuality, and the fact that I will NOT lie about it or keep an integral part of me in the dark? I wasn’t engaging in any “sexual immorality” with other men, and yet my sexuality was still an issue? Really?

And so I began to work with my Family Ward Bishop. I began to work full time, and just focus on living my life. I finished my counseling sessions. And life was pretty good - I was making great headway towards becoming the man the Bishop wanted me to be! One thing that he wouldn’t stop reminding me of, however, is the resources that the church provides for those who may be of another sexuality than heterosexual, or those affected by the sins of the non-hetero. And how, maybe if I prayed more, maybe if I studied the scriptures more, I’d find my attraction fade. In a much less pushy way than the Branch President, but still, it was present.

And then the first Sunday of December came. I was trying my hardest to still believe, I was swallowing all of my doubts, doubting my doubts, and then I met with my Bishop, to see if I would be granted back into full standing in the church. To reconvene the Disciplinary Council and pray together and have me discuss my sins that I had been “forgiven” for already in order for them to decide that they felt that I was ready. And my Bishop looked me in the eyes and said that no, I was NOT ready. That, yes, I had made great headway, but I was NOT ready. The temple? No, not at all. Good standing with the church? No. I was to stay on probation as I moved to Utah for school, and have to go through the whole process one more time with yet another Priesthood Leader.

And then he did it again. His last remark? That I should look up the “mormon and gay” resources. See if they could help. I told him that my sexual preferences held no sway over my “worthiness” in the church because I WAS FOLLOWING THE RULES, and HAD BEEN, for MONTHS. I was trying my BEST - and it WASN’T ENOUGH.

That was when my shelf broke, if you will.

I just stopped trying to hold it in.

I stopped holding back my true self, my true nature, as a seeker of truth and a lover of open honesty. And I began to truly research all of my doubts, to look into things, and wow, was I hurt by those. I had read some of the “Classics in Mormon Thought” talks in the past, and a few of the “Gospel Topic Essays”, but now that I read them without the lenses of “how can this fit into the narrative that I have been fed”, I could not BELIEVE what I was reading!

And then I read the Letter to a CES Director. His experiences, his doubts, his story, felt so close to mine, in ways. I felt for him - how hard he fought to stay in, how much he wanted the truth. And I feel the same.

If you have not read the “Gospel Topic Essays” and the “Letter to a CES Director”, I do not feel that we can converse over my faith appropriately. I refuse to hold a dialogue with someone over my faith unless we are on equal footing.

Reading these felt like validation for all of the things I had held inside for so long. And the fact that the church had taught me to doubt first my doubts, to stay in the boat, to pray to God, not search Google, for things that the church literally published on their own website is absurd. I felt absolutely violated. I felt lied to. I felt gaslit. These facts were not the narrative I was instructed to teach. I already detested Brigham Young, but now I find out that Joseph Smith had an appetite for younger women, hid it, and consistently lied about it?

There is no room in my soul, or my mind, for the belief that he was a Prophet of God.

I find it hard to believe in Christ, now. After all that I have learned, all that I have been through, by the hands of those who professed to be acting in His name.

I find it hard to believe in a God, as well. This, I am working on, but if I’m honest, I need time and space and breathing room from religion as a whole just so that I can make sure I have a good grasp on myself, on my true self.

Because I spent a good while hiding it, berating it, being guilty about it, for fear that I was a sinner.

How sad is that?

That your faith can destroy the sense of self worth, validation, and even joy, if you don’t follow the tenets. And even when you do, if someone in a higher authority position than you thinks you aren’t, you’ll still be wracked by guilt and pain because obviously, God is telling him something that He isn’t telling ME.

It’s disgusting. I feel disgusted. Hurt. Lied to. And, above all, I feel like myself again, now that I am done hiding. I am done being told “Oh, no, don’t go telling people about our meetings and what you’ve been through, you’ll hurt their faith.” I was told, so many times, that I have the ability to “lead thousands of souls, either into heaven, or hell.”

I do not profess to know which one is which.

I want to live my life on purpose, with no reason for regret.

I want to be myself, and if I find God again, to do it on my own terms, to learn of Him at my own pace, and not be told that if I pray and receive a “no” that it obviously came from the Devil.

No.

I am done with this game.

I am done with this faith, this lifestyle, with “masking” who and what I am.

I am a human, at the end of the day. And this is something I know.

That is all.

And that is enough.
